# fortran-wringer-tests

A collection of non-portable Fortran usage, standard-conformant or otherwise.

This directory holds a collection of some Fortran test programs that
I have accumulated during the development of the f18 Fortran compiler
(also known as "LLVM Flang").
I wrote these programs when my reading of the Fortran 2018 standard
was not clear or when I encountered some language extensions in
real codes.

The comments about results from the various Fortran compilers to which
I have access are not meant to imply that there are bugs or any
deficiencies in any of these compilers, just that the results that
I observed varied quite a bit.

It is likely that some or all of these compilers have evolved since
I collected these results; please be sure to verify them against
their most recent releases before doing anything with this data.

Please submit updated results, comments about standard conformance,
and more weird Fortran usage tests as pull requests to this
repository.
